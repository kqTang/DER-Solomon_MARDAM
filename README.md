# DER-Solomon_MARDAM

We plan to release the detailed source code as open-source in the near future. However, for now, you can check out the experimental results related to MARDAM, LKH, and OR-Tools that have been tested on the Solomon benchmark. You can find these results right here. 

Now, when it comes to the MARDAM results, we've got two sets of data. One was trained with the original data introduced by its author, and the other with DER-Solomon data introduced by us. Interestingly, the results show that the latter performs significantly better. Just a quick note, though â€“ the results may not match up perfectly with what you'll find in our paper due to some randomness, but the overall trends and average values are quite similar.
